                <p class="p5">Vessels embodies what I needed during my battle with anxiety and deep depression years
                    ago—a brand that understands your process to wholeness. Through self-inquiry, I've realized the
                    profound power of inner healing and realized, in the universal truth of oneness. I'm deeply
                    passionate about sharing the NOW Method with the world.
                    Now, as a Meditation teacher, Breathwork Facilitator and Integration Coach, I aim to hold space for
                    others as they discover this truth within themselves. Acknowledging the self, plant medicine,
                    meditation, fasting and breathwork have been pivotal in my personal journey, and I believe in their
                    potential for global healing.</p>
